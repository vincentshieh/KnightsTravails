# Knight's Travails

Knight's Travails is an implementation of a Ruby class that finds a path for a
chess knight from a starting position to an end position on a standard 8x8
chess board. The ```KnightPathFinder``` class uses the ```PolyTreeNode```
class to build a move tree from the starting position, then uses breadth-first
search to locate the path to the end position.
